<div>
<p class="p1">Wawel Castle is located in Krakow.
    Wawel is on a 228 meter high hill overlooking the Wisla River in South of the Old City.
    The Wawel Royal Castle symbolizes the golden age of Poland, or rather the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom
    - then one of the largest in Europe.
    The castle was built in the 14th century as a royal residence, under the orders of King Casimir III.
    Later, in the reign of Ladislas II Jagellon and Hedwige, it was increased in size. </p>
