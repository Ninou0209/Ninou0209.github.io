        St. Mary's Basilica in Krakow is located on the Main Market Square (Rynek) in the Old Town of Krakow.
        Before becoming the iconic Gothic church of Krakow, several legends mingle with its history. Certainly to make more interesting. </p>

<h2 class="title">  The legent of two brothers  </h2>

<img class="displayed" src="basilicahistory.jpg"  width="450"  height="600">
<p>n 1400 we rebuild the church in Gothic style. The king has his cathedral at the castle, the wealthy bourgeois have their basilica on the market place.

    The two towers are not the same size. Neither the same form. The legend says that two brothers would have competed for their construction. In the beginning, construction took place on both the north tower and the south tower. Then the elder took the lead and his younger brother could not stand it. So he killed him as it was the habit of the middle ages when we were upset. Of course the killer died of an accident in one version and a suicide following his persistent remorse in a second.  </p>
