      Deployed on both sides of the Vistula River and capital of Poland since the end of the 16th century, this shining city in the Golden Age was removed from the map in 1945.
      Carefully reconstructed by the Polish people on the basis of the ancient plans of the medieval order, the unique architectural ensemble of the Old Town (Stare Miasto) with its beautiful Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic frescoes is elevated to World Heritage status by Unesco.
      Emblem of reconstruction, the Royal Castle where sat the kings of Poland since the eighteenth century, houses some 300 collector's items and sumptuous richly decorated rooms.
